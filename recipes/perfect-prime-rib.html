    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        If you've ever carved into a prime rib at a big holiday meal expecting a juicy,<br> perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry, overcooked roast, this recipe is for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        This simple, foolproof "mathematical method" for making the very best prime rib will greatly increase your chances of success.<br> Here is the formula: Multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes. For me it was 5.35 x 5 = 26.75 minutes, which we round up to 27.
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll cook your room-temperature prime rib at 500 degrees F for exactly that many minutes.<br> (Twenty-seven minutes, in my case.) Then turn off the oven and wait 2 hours without opening the door.<br> When the time's up, remove the prime rib and slice into the most perfectly medium-rare meat you've ever seen.<br> See? That's all it takes to make foolproof prime rib cooked to a perfect pink that's somewhere just a shade under medium rare.<br> Just make sure you're starting with a prime rib that has been brought to room temperature! This is critical in order for the math to work!
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, while the method could not be easier, there are a couple things that this method requires: a full-size, modern oven with a digital temperature setting that indicates when it is preheated. <br>Older ovens with manual controls can vary greatly, and the doors may not have the proper insulation. <br> Here's another pro tip for you: Because prime rib is expensive, you should always insert a probe-style thermometer to monitor the internal temp of your roast and avoid any chance of over-cooking. <br> Set the probe alarm (125 F for medium-rare) just in case, and pull the prime rib from oven even if there's still time left on the oven timer.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) <em>prime rib roast</em></li>
        <li>Â¼ cup <em>unsalted butter</em>, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground <em>black pepper</em></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon <em>herbes de Provence</em></li>
        <li>kosher <em>salt</em> to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place <em>prime rib roast</em> on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours.
        </li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>

        <li>
            Combine <em>butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence</em> in a bowl; mix until well blended. Spread <em>butter mixture</em> evenly over entire <em>roast</em>. Season <em>roast</em> generously with kosher salt.
        </li>

        <li>
            Roast the 4-pound <em>roast</em> in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If your <em>roast</em> is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.)
        </li>

        <li>
            Turn the oven off and, leaving the <em>roast</em> in the oven with the door closed, let the <em>roast</em> sit in the oven for 2 hours.
        </li>

        <li>Remove <em>roast</em> from the oven, slice, and serve.</li>
